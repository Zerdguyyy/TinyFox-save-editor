Save editor for Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. Use at your own risk! Save editing can often lead to unintended game states or softlocks.

Untested on any OS other than Windows because I don't own any OS other than Windows, sorry :(

Saved games for Bo on windows are stored in your appdata folder: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\LocalLow\Squid Shock Studios\Bo. If you can't see the appdata folder in your file explorer, you likely need to turn on hidden files from the View menu.

Released versions are here:
